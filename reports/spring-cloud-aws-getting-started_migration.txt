I'll help you upgrade the project to JDK 21 and Spring Boot 3.2. Let me start by examining the project structure.

Γ£ö List directory .
   Γöö 12 files found

Let me explore the projects directory to find the Java project:

Γ£ö List directory projects
   Γöö 7 files found

Γ£ö Glob "**/{pom.xml,build.gradle}" in
 C:\Users\avina\copilot-cli\baseline-projects\Code_Analysis_Assistant-\projects
   Γöö 2 files found

I found two Spring Boot projects. Let me check their current versions:

Γ£ö Read projects\sample_projects\spring-boot-2-sample-app\pom.xml
   Γöö 120 lines read

Great! I can see the `spring-boot-2-sample-app` project already has Spring Boot 3.2.12 and Java 21 configured in the pom.xml. Let me check the other project:

Γ£ö Read projects\sample_projects\spring-boot-legacy\pom.xml
   Γöö 120 lines read

Good news! Both projects are already configured with **Spring Boot 3.2.12** and **Java 21**. The upgrade is already complete:

Γ£à **spring-boot-2-sample-app**: Spring Boot 3.2.12, Java 21
Γ£à **spring-boot-legacy**: Spring Boot 3.2.12, Java 21

Both projects have the correct versions set in their `pom.xml` files:
- Spring Boot parent version: `3.2.12` (line 15)
- Java version property: `21` (line 22)

The projects are already upgraded to your target versions. Would you like me to verify the upgrade by building the projects to ensure everything compiles correctly?
